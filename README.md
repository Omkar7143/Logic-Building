# 🧠 Logic Building Repository

A comprehensive collection of programming problems and mini-projects focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
This repository showcases my **dedication**, **problem-solving mindset**, and continuous effort to strengthen core programming skills.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo includes solutions to a wide range of logic-building and DSA problems implemented in:

- ✅ C  
- ✅ C++  
- ✅ Java  

It covers a variety of topics including arrays, strings, recursion, searching, sorting, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

Whether solving classic problems or building mini-projects, this repository reflects my **hands-on approach to learning**.
